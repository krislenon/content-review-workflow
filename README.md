## Overview

This document outlines the end-to-end process for reviewing academic solutions submitted by external tutors. It includes reviewer responsibilities, review steps, and escalation protocols.

**Audience:** Internal content developers  
**Purpose:** To standardize the academic content review process, improve alignment, and reduce quality issues across the Computer Science team.

## Step 1: Accessing the Review Tool
* Go to the **Review Queue Tool**.
* Select the subject(s) you want to review and begin queueing for review items.

---

## Step 2: Initial Assessment  
* Refer to the **Review Guidelines Document** for detailed criteria.
* Count the number of questions in the current review item.
* Verify that the question meets the following conditions:
  * It is complete (no major parts missing)
  * It is free of copyright issues
  * It is clearly answerable
* If the question fails any of these checks, skip it using the appropriate reason code based on the guidelines.

## Step 3: Technical Review
Once the question has been validated, proceed to review the solution using the **Universal Rubric**. Follow the instructions below for each component:
* Answer: Evaluate the accuracy of the final answer. Provide feedback if it is incorrect.
* Explanation: Assess the clarity and correctness of the explanation. Write feedback if it does not meet standards.
* Overall Compliance: Ensure the solution follows all formatting, language, and instructional guidelines. Leave feedback if it violates any compliance rules.

## Step 4: Feedback & Scoring
* Write clear and constructive feedback based on the **Feedback Guidelines**.
* If you identify any issues in the solution, click the **Moderator Tool** button to flag the item.
* Ensure your feedback is specific, actionable, and aligned with the review standards.

## Step 5: Special Cases
* If you are unsure about the quality or correctness of the content, consult your immediate senior reviewer before proceeding.
* For submissions with compliance issues (e.g., plagiarism, offensive content, policy violations), report the item using the designated Google Form.

## Notes
* Use the Tracker Tool to monitor subject queues and review assignments.
* Track your time using Worksnap, and make sure to log any manual tasks as required.
